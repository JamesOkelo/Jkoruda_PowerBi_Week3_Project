An interactive visualization tool of the results for the first crop season


As a Data Scientist, the agri-tech team is asking you to develop an interactive
visualization tool of the results for this first crop season. This visualization tool
you will develop will be used as a first mockup of the Food Security Monitoring
tool that DDI will develop for the NGO.
Based on your experience, the team expects you to develop a first draft within
the coming three working days. They give you carte blanche in terms of structure
and functionalities, but they know that the client wants:

At least a map in the dashboard

The possibility of visualizing the results by district or sub-county (two
administrative levels used by the NGO)
